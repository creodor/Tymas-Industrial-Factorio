bugs:

-improved logistics/construction tech isn't showing the name set in locale. the hell. 



-Proper recipes for casting forge and metal furnace
-Better colors for molten metals inside the pipes



ideas:

-Solar panel, maybe a chemical doping process (ant had a good idea for once)? From Dakkan, if chemicals involved, make it more beastly.

-upgrade flamethrower. currently it's barely even useful for tree clearance. see where damage comes from, and upgrade *that* item. if fuel, new more difficult processing.
-will need another level of conveyors for the new machinery, probably. verify before adding.
-flamethrower turret? can see it being TK happy, though.
-wooden palisades for early defense
-steel reinforced walls for later defense
-global effects for pollution. what should these be? make trees grow, then kill them eventually?:
14:59 <Dakkan> We vaguely talked about it I think. Player damage without power
               armor and stuff like that. Maybe reduced solar panel output.

-recycler/compacter device:
[14:46:18] Creodor: it...
[14:46:33] Creodor: might be possible to do something, maybe
[14:46:55] Hessuu: I would imagine it's possible to hardcode things at least
[14:46:58] Creodor: i think we're limited to one output, no matter what
[14:47:06] Hessuu: if basic inserter, give 10 iron
[14:47:28] Creodor: as long as i'm not interfacing with the actual game engine, i can do anything lua can
[14:47:30] Creodor: which is a lot
[14:47:54] Creodor: and all the entities/items/etc are in lua in various places; none hardcoded
[14:48:29] Creodor: so i should be able to at least reverse lookup the recipe from the item inserted, find the base metal of that or most common item or w/e
[14:48:33] Creodor: and spit out some of that
[14:49:02] Creodor: it'd be a highly inefficient recycler, but it's something
[14:49:20] Creodor: the biggest issue is that there's nothing that outputs multiple items yet, at all
http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=6603  < can do multiple outputs after all

-should add new enemies before/with/shortly after new defenses and weapons. probably with or after.

15:07 <Dakkan> I don't think it'd be possible yet, but eventually I'd like to
               see trees regrow for constant battles against nature.
15:07 <Creodor> but the minute something involves the engine...
15:07 <Creodor> aye
15:08 <Creodor> it would be nice
15:08 <Creodor> you go off on a long exploration trip, come back to a base with
                trees in the way
15:08 <Dakkan> Specialized green blueprints for removing only trees.
15:09 <Dakkan> So any tree appearing in the zone will be automatically removed.
15:09 <Creodor> robots are ever-useful.
15:09 <Creodor> can potentially already make that setup, with the robot mining
                events
15:09 <Creodor> which would.......
15:10 <Creodor> i need to see if i can do that.
15:10 <Creodor> because if so, fuck the trees forever.
15:10 <Dakkan> Also, robot-tree-murder needs to count towards player kills of
               trees.
15:10 <Creodor> haha. eventually, sure
15:10 <Creodor> but that one isn't gonna be moddable yet
15:11 <Dakkan> Just a side thought.
15:12 <Creodor> sure

15:13 <Dakkan> Also, if we're going to continue building up off of vanilla, it
               really seems we need some sort of high density packaging system.
               Maybe not for everything, or maybe just for one or two things.
               But I'm just noticing this bottleneck where I'm doing silly
               things that don't feel... game-like.
15:13 <Creodor> examples?
15:16 <Dakkan> Or hell, not even technically packaging, but an alternate mode
               of processing shit. Specifically iron and copper. My
               distribution system for the two is getting silly. A cooler, more
               Factorio-esque scenario would be to "mass process" ~15 into
               molten metal which could be piped instead of conveyored, and was
               much more dense. Drawbacks would obviously include more
               expensive initial processing, and more expensi
15:16 <Dakkan> ve end point processing.
15:17 <Dakkan> Unlike a conveyor, you wouldn't be able to just pull resources
               out of the pipe, you'd need a "metal casting" stage to get
               regular plates back out of it.
15:19 <Dakkan> Benefits would be high density metal storage and transport.
               Drawbacks would be high energy investment and overall cost.
15:20 <Creodor> i like the idea, main thing i feel i'm missing is: where is
                this intermediate casting step?
15:20 <Creodor> is that meant to be during recipes, or at some other factory
15:21 <Creodor> i have noticed that at higher levels iron/copper become very
                difficult to move around efficiently though
15:21 <Dakkan> Some sort of smeltery coverts large amounts of ore/metal plates
               into molten metal. This is pipe-able, maybe not through
               traditional pipes but something similar.
15:21 <Creodor> i end up with some chains that barely use any and other that
                are bone dry of the stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:22 <Dakkan> Then at any point you'd want to pull metal plates out of the
               system you'd hook the pipe-esque thing into a casting building
               to cast plates.
15:23 <Dakkan> I usually have just strings of the 3x3 chests with 3 transporter
               arms moving items en masse. It just doesn't feel right.
15:23 <Creodor> and then use that to feed nearby machines...
15:23 <Dakkan> Yeah.
15:23 <Creodor> ant's setup. i hate it.
15:23 <Creodor> it works faster, but i hate it
15:23 <Dakkan> I know.
15:23 <Creodor> it's fucking stupid
15:23 <Creodor> also, i'm thinking that the heat transferral between pipes
                could come into play here.
15:23 <Dakkan> Especially at stuff like train stations when you need to get the
               shit unloaded AND out of the way as fast as possible, it's
               basically a requirement though.
15:24 <Creodor> need to keep the metals at x temp, and over pipe length you
                lose it, so have to run hot water pipes alongside sometimes
15:24 <Dakkan> Hell, you could have the pipes require electricity to keep them
               molten.
15:24 <Dakkan> Ooh, that's a good idea too.
15:24 <Creodor> i prefer hot water to electricity, but either could work
15:24 <Dakkan> Err, not the hot water bit. That's meh.
15:24 <Creodor> eh.
15:25 <Dakkan> Because boiling water is still very cold in metal terms.
15:25 <Creodor> either way, molten metal will bleed heat.
15:25 <Creodor> yeah
15:25 <Creodor> 's true
15:25 <Dakkan> But this could be a reason for a few tiers of insulated pipes.
               Each one prevents heat loss slightly better.
15:25 <Creodor> shame, but oh well.
15:25 <Creodor> i'd rather not have too many. but yeah, i can see that.
15:26 <Dakkan> AND your idea of metal heating boilers to increase heat
               occasionally.
15:26 <Creodor> the water would have to get very hot to manage that, as you
                pointed out
15:27 <Creodor> at those temps i imagine the pressure would be insane
15:27 <Dakkan> Err, nono. You have the molten metal flow through a boiler.
               Which is not really a boiler at that point I guess.
15:27 <Creodor> ohhhh
15:27 <Dakkan> But a re-heater, I guess.
15:27 <Dakkan> Because I also have insane amounts of physical fuel lying around.
15:27 <Creodor> an actual purpose made metal-boiler
15:28 <Dakkan> And that would be a use for it.
15:28 <Dakkan> Thermal regulator.
15:28 <Dakkan> We can't really call it a boiler.
15:28 <Creodor> better name
15:28 <Dakkan> But I'm just looking to avoid this bullshit
               http://i.imgur.com/jwS82Jx.jpg
15:28 <Dakkan> And those are the DyTech stupid fast arms.


15:36 <Dakkan> This is interesting now. We can assign heat capacity to liquids.
               So it'll require more fuel to raise the temperature more.
15:36 <Creodor> ooohhh
15:36 <Creodor> very good
15:37 <Dakkan> We would need some way to "require" the output casting stage to
               bet at a certain temperature though.
15:37 <Creodor> i might be able to rig up something lua-magicy if necessary
15:37 <Creodor> depends on how much i can do without talking to the engine
15:38 <Dakkan> Dafuque. The various oils have heat capacities and max
               temperatures too... have you ever tried to run them through a
               boiler?

---

-new boiler that uses liquid oil-based fuels?
-wind power, game already has adjustable windspeed/orientation. should be able to use that. ( http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lua/Game )

11:08 <Creodor> heh. found a way to place trees.
11:08 <Dakkan> Oh?
11:09 <Creodor>  if (game.canplaceentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}})
                then
11:09 <Creodor>      game.createentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}}
11:09 <Creodor>   end
11:09 <Creodor> replace the position with a semi-random value
11:09 <Dakkan> Have a clock randomly place trees in random locations a distance
               x away from player?
11:10 <Creodor> mhm
11:10 <Creodor> clock based on pollution
11:10 <Creodor> dat co2
11:10 <Creodor> dunno how to grab pollution though, yet
11:11 <Dakkan> I was thinking on that. There should be a peak point where a
               little CO2 increases tree growth, but then growth declines again.
11:11 <Creodor> yes
11:11 <Creodor> already noted that somewhere
11:11 <Creodor> increase growth, then start removing trees, or preferably,
                replacing them with dead ones
11:12 <Dakkan> Ooh, yeah. Replacing them would be great.
11:13 <Creodor> by clock, check if entity at $position == tree then
                entity.destroy() && game.createentity{name="dead-tree",
                $position}
getpollution
Takes Lua/Position and returns Types/double of pollution for the chunk given position was in.



notes:

-also, construction one is giving a blueprint timeout upgrade? how?:
      {
        type = "ghost-time-to-live",
        modifier = 60 * 60 * 20
      }
