bugs:

-improved logistics/construction tech isn't showing the name set in locale. the hell. 



-Proper recipes for casting forge and metal furnace
-Better colors for molten metals inside the pipes



ideas:

-Solar panel, maybe a chemical doping process (ant had a good idea for once)? From Dakkan, if chemicals involved, make it more beastly.

-upgrade flamethrower. currently it's barely even useful for tree clearance. see where damage comes from, and upgrade *that* item. if fuel, new more difficult processing.
-will need another level of conveyors for the new machinery, probably. verify before adding.
-flamethrower turret? can see it being TK happy, though.
-wooden palisades for early defense
-steel reinforced walls for later defense
-global effects for pollution. what should these be? make trees grow, then kill them eventually?:
14:59 <Dakkan> We vaguely talked about it I think. Player damage without power
               armor and stuff like that. Maybe reduced solar panel output.

-recycler/compacter device:
[14:46:18] Creodor: it...
[14:46:33] Creodor: might be possible to do something, maybe
[14:46:55] Hessuu: I would imagine it's possible to hardcode things at least
[14:46:58] Creodor: i think we're limited to one output, no matter what
[14:47:06] Hessuu: if basic inserter, give 10 iron
[14:47:28] Creodor: as long as i'm not interfacing with the actual game engine, i can do anything lua can
[14:47:30] Creodor: which is a lot
[14:47:54] Creodor: and all the entities/items/etc are in lua in various places; none hardcoded
[14:48:29] Creodor: so i should be able to at least reverse lookup the recipe from the item inserted, find the base metal of that or most common item or w/e
[14:48:33] Creodor: and spit out some of that
[14:49:02] Creodor: it'd be a highly inefficient recycler, but it's something
[14:49:20] Creodor: the biggest issue is that there's nothing that outputs multiple items yet, at all
http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=6603  < can do multiple outputs after all

-should add new enemies before/with/shortly after new defenses and weapons. probably with or after.

15:07 <Dakkan> I don't think it'd be possible yet, but eventually I'd like to
               see trees regrow for constant battles against nature.
15:07 <Creodor> but the minute something involves the engine...
15:07 <Creodor> aye
15:08 <Creodor> it would be nice
15:08 <Creodor> you go off on a long exploration trip, come back to a base with
                trees in the way
15:08 <Dakkan> Specialized green blueprints for removing only trees.
15:09 <Dakkan> So any tree appearing in the zone will be automatically removed.
15:09 <Creodor> robots are ever-useful.
15:09 <Creodor> can potentially already make that setup, with the robot mining
                events
15:09 <Creodor> which would.......
15:10 <Creodor> i need to see if i can do that.
15:10 <Creodor> because if so, fuck the trees forever.
15:10 <Dakkan> Also, robot-tree-murder needs to count towards player kills of
               trees.
15:10 <Creodor> haha. eventually, sure
15:10 <Creodor> but that one isn't gonna be moddable yet
15:11 <Dakkan> Just a side thought.
15:12 <Creodor> sure


----

15:23 <Creodor> also, i'm thinking that the heat transferral between pipes
                could come into play here.
15:23 <Dakkan> Especially at stuff like train stations when you need to get the
               shit unloaded AND out of the way as fast as possible, it's
               basically a requirement though.
15:24 <Creodor> need to keep the metals at x temp, and over pipe length you
                lose it, so have to run hot water pipes alongside sometimes
15:24 <Dakkan> Hell, you could have the pipes require electricity to keep them
               molten.
15:24 <Dakkan> Ooh, that's a good idea too.
15:24 <Creodor> i prefer hot water to electricity, but either could work
15:24 <Dakkan> Err, not the hot water bit. That's meh.
15:24 <Creodor> eh.
15:25 <Dakkan> Because boiling water is still very cold in metal terms.
15:25 <Creodor> either way, molten metal will bleed heat.
15:25 <Creodor> yeah
15:25 <Creodor> 's true
15:25 <Dakkan> But this could be a reason for a few tiers of insulated pipes.
               Each one prevents heat loss slightly better.
15:25 <Creodor> shame, but oh well.
15:25 <Creodor> i'd rather not have too many. but yeah, i can see that.
15:26 <Dakkan> AND your idea of metal heating boilers to increase heat
               occasionally.
15:26 <Creodor> the water would have to get very hot to manage that, as you
                pointed out
15:27 <Creodor> at those temps i imagine the pressure would be insane
15:27 <Dakkan> Err, nono. You have the molten metal flow through a boiler.
               Which is not really a boiler at that point I guess.
15:27 <Creodor> ohhhh
15:27 <Dakkan> But a re-heater, I guess.
15:27 <Dakkan> Because I also have insane amounts of physical fuel lying around.
15:27 <Creodor> an actual purpose made metal-boiler
15:28 <Dakkan> And that would be a use for it.
15:28 <Dakkan> Thermal regulator.
15:28 <Dakkan> We can't really call it a boiler.
15:28 <Creodor> better name
15:28 <Dakkan> But I'm just looking to avoid this bullshit
               http://i.imgur.com/jwS82Jx.jpg
15:28 <Dakkan> And those are the DyTech stupid fast arms.


15:36 <Dakkan> This is interesting now. We can assign heat capacity to liquids.
               So it'll require more fuel to raise the temperature more.
15:36 <Creodor> ooohhh
15:36 <Creodor> very good
15:37 <Dakkan> We would need some way to "require" the output casting stage to
               bet at a certain temperature though.
15:37 <Creodor> i might be able to rig up something lua-magicy if necessary
15:37 <Creodor> depends on how much i can do without talking to the engine
15:38 <Dakkan> Dafuque. The various oils have heat capacities and max
               temperatures too... have you ever tried to run them through a
               boiler?

---

-new boiler that uses liquid oil-based fuels?
-wind power, game already has adjustable windspeed/orientation. should be able to use that. ( http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lua/Game )

11:08 <Creodor> heh. found a way to place trees.
11:08 <Dakkan> Oh?
11:09 <Creodor>  if (game.canplaceentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}})
                then
11:09 <Creodor>      game.createentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}}
11:09 <Creodor>   end
11:09 <Creodor> replace the position with a semi-random value
11:09 <Dakkan> Have a clock randomly place trees in random locations a distance
               x away from player?
11:10 <Creodor> mhm
11:10 <Creodor> clock based on pollution
11:10 <Creodor> dat co2
11:10 <Creodor> dunno how to grab pollution though, yet
11:11 <Dakkan> I was thinking on that. There should be a peak point where a
               little CO2 increases tree growth, but then growth declines again.
11:11 <Creodor> yes
11:11 <Creodor> already noted that somewhere
11:11 <Creodor> increase growth, then start removing trees, or preferably,
                replacing them with dead ones
11:12 <Dakkan> Ooh, yeah. Replacing them would be great.
11:13 <Creodor> by clock, check if entity at $position == tree then
                entity.destroy() && game.createentity{name="dead-tree",
                $position}
getpollution
Takes Lua/Position and returns Types/double of pollution for the chunk given position was in.



notes:

-also, construction one is giving a blueprint timeout upgrade? how?:
      {
        type = "ghost-time-to-live",
        modifier = 60 * 60 * 20
      }
