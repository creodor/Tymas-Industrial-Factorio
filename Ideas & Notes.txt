bug- large/medium smart chests aren't smart. check if logistics chests should be smart too.

stbugs:
-Better colors for molten metals inside the pipes
-Capsule turrets, when firing drones capsules, are crashing the game, on the Tymas mod. The base files do not seem to do this. Wut.



Important notes:
-No collision box set, projectiles can't collide, at least for several tested projectile types.
	-Flame-thrower-explosion type projectiles will not be able to collide past the weapons firing range. Likely for other types as well.



Backburner problems:
-New tier power armors, can't seem to adjust player speed.


ideas:
-Next tier gun: Gatling, sniper, explosive.
-Planetary Satellite: Stupidly ranged area scanner. This is especially vital for more populated servers, but a server with Dakkan on it needs one too. (Hehe.)

-Mohovian Miner (TA name inspiration (Total Annihilation, for Creodor)) AKA sub mantle metal extractor: megastructure. 
	-Energy requirements set so high that they're not likely to be met, so total energy production dictates speed of resources ejected.
	-Ejects massive quantities of mantle magma.
		-Mantle Magma is processed into mostly rock, but some iron/copper. (We may want to consider a new resource at this point of the game.)
			-This massive surplus of rock is a new game mechanic. "WUT DO WITH LOTS OF STUPID RESOURCE?" (Pave the earf, wall the earf. Do something, but you can't automate it.)
		-There would be intense sorting needed as well for the byproducts.

-Drone: Set to enemy, give weapon that does negative damage, have zero hit box (So you/defenses can't shoot at it), it heals player/player allies.

-Charging tower: Trimmed down roboport specially designed to charge large amounts of drones at high charging speeds. Expensive, fuck you.
	-Notes: Game mechanics do not allow drones to logically deciding on charging port. They choose nearest acceptable port, no matter wut.
		-Due to this, it may be a better game mechanic to have very few charging port, but absurd charging rates. The desired effect is to charge more drones faster, so we need to account for a shitton of drones. Perhaps a high energy drain or sommat.

-Injection Pumpjack

-Use the destroyer attack weapon for a player weapon

-Siege monster, long range but low defenses, monster countermeasure to long range missile turrets
-Laser gun, absurd fire rate and projectile speed to give illusion of beam effect.

----------------------------------------------------------
9/12/2015 - Dakkan

New Tier of gameplay to match molten metal mechanics
	-New "Foundry" or "Casting" building, acts as new tier of assembly building for giant parts.
		-Items too large to be held in inventory.
			-Is it possible to increase item size on ground?
			-Is it possible to prevent player from picking up items on ground?
				-Could use vehicles entity category as items and set to non-mineable.
		-Moved using "heavy conveyor belts", which are slow.
			-If possible, these conveyors should be 2x2 instead of 1x1. We goin' biiig.
				-currently does not appear to be possible to scale up conveyor entity.
	-Larger moving arm for moving from conveyor to destination.
		

----------------------------------------------------------------

tweak adv steam engine; uses no extra temp and could substitute directly without upgrading water

-Solar panel, maybe a chemical doping process (ant had a good idea for once)? From Dakkan, if chemicals involved, make it more beastly.

-upgrade flamethrower. currently it's barely even useful for tree clearance. see where damage comes from, and upgrade *that* item. if fuel, new more difficult processing.
-will need another level of conveyors for the new machinery, probably. verify before adding.
-flamethrower turret? can see it being TK happy, though.
(DONE)-wooden palisades for early defense
(DONE)-steel reinforced walls for later defense
-global effects for pollution. what should these be? make trees grow, then kill them eventually?:
14:59 <Dakkan> We vaguely talked about it I think. Player damage without power
               armor and stuff like that. Maybe reduced solar panel output.

-recycler/compacter device:
[14:46:18] Creodor: it...
[14:46:33] Creodor: might be possible to do something, maybe
[14:46:55] Hessuu: I would imagine it's possible to hardcode things at least
[14:46:58] Creodor: i think we're limited to one output, no matter what
[14:47:06] Hessuu: if basic inserter, give 10 iron
[14:47:28] Creodor: as long as i'm not interfacing with the actual game engine, i can do anything lua can
[14:47:30] Creodor: which is a lot
[14:47:54] Creodor: and all the entities/items/etc are in lua in various places; none hardcoded
[14:48:29] Creodor: so i should be able to at least reverse lookup the recipe from the item inserted, find the base metal of that or most common item or w/e
[14:48:33] Creodor: and spit out some of that
[14:49:02] Creodor: it'd be a highly inefficient recycler, but it's something
[14:49:20] Creodor: the biggest issue is that there's nothing that outputs multiple items yet, at all
http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=6603  < can do multiple outputs after all

-should add new enemies before/with/shortly after new defenses and weapons. probably with or after.

15:07 <Dakkan> I don't think it'd be possible yet, but eventually I'd like to
               see trees regrow for constant battles against nature.
15:07 <Creodor> but the minute something involves the engine...
15:07 <Creodor> aye
15:08 <Creodor> it would be nice
15:08 <Creodor> you go off on a long exploration trip, come back to a base with
                trees in the way
15:08 <Dakkan> Specialized green blueprints for removing only trees.
15:09 <Dakkan> So any tree appearing in the zone will be automatically removed.
15:09 <Creodor> robots are ever-useful.
15:09 <Creodor> can potentially already make that setup, with the robot mining
                events
15:09 <Creodor> which would.......
15:10 <Creodor> i need to see if i can do that.
15:10 <Creodor> because if so, fuck the trees forever.
15:10 <Dakkan> Also, robot-tree-murder needs to count towards player kills of
               trees.
15:10 <Creodor> haha. eventually, sure
15:10 <Creodor> but that one isn't gonna be moddable yet
15:11 <Dakkan> Just a side thought.
15:12 <Creodor> sure


----

15:23 <Creodor> also, i'm thinking that the heat transferral between pipes
                could come into play here.
15:23 <Dakkan> Especially at stuff like train stations when you need to get the
               shit unloaded AND out of the way as fast as possible, it's
               basically a requirement though.
15:24 <Creodor> need to keep the metals at x temp, and over pipe length you
                lose it, so have to run hot water pipes alongside sometimes
15:24 <Dakkan> Hell, you could have the pipes require electricity to keep them
               molten.
15:24 <Dakkan> Ooh, that's a good idea too.
15:24 <Creodor> i prefer hot water to electricity, but either could work
15:24 <Dakkan> Err, not the hot water bit. That's meh.
15:24 <Creodor> eh.
15:25 <Dakkan> Because boiling water is still very cold in metal terms.
15:25 <Creodor> either way, molten metal will bleed heat.
15:25 <Creodor> yeah
15:25 <Creodor> 's true
15:25 <Dakkan> But this could be a reason for a few tiers of insulated pipes.
               Each one prevents heat loss slightly better.
15:25 <Creodor> shame, but oh well.
15:25 <Creodor> i'd rather not have too many. but yeah, i can see that.
15:26 <Dakkan> AND your idea of metal heating boilers to increase heat
               occasionally.
15:26 <Creodor> the water would have to get very hot to manage that, as you
                pointed out
15:27 <Creodor> at those temps i imagine the pressure would be insane
15:27 <Dakkan> Err, nono. You have the molten metal flow through a boiler.
               Which is not really a boiler at that point I guess.
15:27 <Creodor> ohhhh
15:27 <Dakkan> But a re-heater, I guess.
15:27 <Dakkan> Because I also have insane amounts of physical fuel lying around.
15:27 <Creodor> an actual purpose made metal-boiler
15:28 <Dakkan> And that would be a use for it.
15:28 <Dakkan> Thermal regulator.
15:28 <Dakkan> We can't really call it a boiler.
15:28 <Creodor> better name
15:28 <Dakkan> But I'm just looking to avoid this bullshit
               http://i.imgur.com/jwS82Jx.jpg
15:28 <Dakkan> And those are the DyTech stupid fast arms.


15:36 <Dakkan> This is interesting now. We can assign heat capacity to liquids.
               So it'll require more fuel to raise the temperature more.
15:36 <Creodor> ooohhh
15:36 <Creodor> very good
15:37 <Dakkan> We would need some way to "require" the output casting stage to
               bet at a certain temperature though.
15:37 <Creodor> i might be able to rig up something lua-magicy if necessary
15:37 <Creodor> depends on how much i can do without talking to the engine
15:38 <Dakkan> Dafuque. The various oils have heat capacities and max
               temperatures too... have you ever tried to run them through a
               boiler?

---

-new boiler that uses liquid oil-based fuels?
-wind power, game already has adjustable windspeed/orientation. should be able to use that. ( http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lua/Game )

---

11:08 <Creodor> heh. found a way to place trees.
11:08 <Dakkan> Oh?
11:09 <Creodor>  if (game.canplaceentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}})
                then
11:09 <Creodor>      game.createentity{name="big-tree", position = {5, 3}}
11:09 <Creodor>   end
11:09 <Creodor> replace the position with a semi-random value
11:09 <Dakkan> Have a clock randomly place trees in random locations a distance
               x away from player?
11:10 <Creodor> mhm
11:10 <Creodor> clock based on pollution
11:10 <Creodor> dat co2
11:10 <Creodor> dunno how to grab pollution though, yet
11:11 <Dakkan> I was thinking on that. There should be a peak point where a
               little CO2 increases tree growth, but then growth declines again.
11:11 <Creodor> yes
11:11 <Creodor> already noted that somewhere
11:11 <Creodor> increase growth, then start removing trees, or preferably,
                replacing them with dead ones
11:12 <Dakkan> Ooh, yeah. Replacing them would be great.
11:13 <Creodor> by clock, check if entity at $position == tree then
                entity.destroy() && game.createentity{name="dead-tree",
                $position}
getpollution
Takes Lua/Position and returns Types/double of pollution for the chunk given position was in.

05:49 PM - Laguna: Could make a high end generator. Fusion - Like a 3 step process or something where you take gas and refine it into liquid hydrogen, and then pump that into a plasma factory, and that into a reactor
05:50 PM - Laguna: makes massive power, but takes a lot of input.

---
12:32 PM - Hessuu: what this game needs is some kind of alert generator
12:32 PM - Hessuu: that reacts to things like mines running out and chests getting emptied


notes:

-balance: will aim for production of 2-4 time better than current top tier, with commiserate cost increase. Err towards costing more rather than less than needed, but try not to go overboard. People will be happy to see cost drop, even if it was too expensive before but angry if it increases.

-also, construction one is giving a blueprint timeout upgrade? how?:
      {
        type = "ghost-time-to-live",
        modifier = 60 * 60 * 20
      }

	  
-fast_replaceable_group = "storage-tanks", needs to be added in for some vanilla recipes
